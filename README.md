## About

A simple example which demonstrates a way to use the Web Storage API to save some user-based styles between page visits. Any styles you pick below should be saved in local storage and will be reloaded whenever you refresh or revisit the page. Based on [MDN Web Storage Example](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-storage/)

## TODO

1. Cleanup the main.js file, it works but it's ugly and repetitive
2. Maybe style the page a little better, do something with fonts or spacing
3. Setup a heroku site that can be used for server-backed apps like this so you can host an example.
